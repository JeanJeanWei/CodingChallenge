# CodingChallenge
This is a demo for using VisualStdudio for Mac to implement a console project to solve commom coding challenges. I also added XUnit test project for unit test. 

It looks like the MS UnitTest project is better on debugging than XUnit test project. I will work on MS UnitTests for know.
